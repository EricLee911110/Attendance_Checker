Have a problem checking whether all the students attend your class? 
Especially when everyone doesn't have their camera on. 
With this tool I made you can easily check who is not in the Google Meet classroom.
Of course, this comparing tool doesn't limit to Google Meet classroom. 
All you need is two CSV file and you're good to go!
